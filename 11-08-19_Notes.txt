NEGOTIATIONS

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ni0PY3b-8D_DYb8Whqd5gZ0FGKZ-gf9_/view

- STYLES OF NEGOTIATING

    - accommodating
        - just very agreeable, followers, but need to show will to demand more
    - avoiding
        - not recommended, essentially avoiding direct conflict and articulating through email for example
        - might be ok with good email, but still not recommended
    - collaborating
        - rob's preferred method
        - kinda like compromising, but finding other ways to include other solutions, like i'm going to get you this much in 1st qtr and i'll want this bonus, or vaca days, etc
    - competing
        - ppl trying to 'win' the negotiation, don't care so much about job but more about the win
    - compromising
        - the constant negotiation of finding a happy middle

- STEPS FOR NEGOTIATING

    - PRE-WORK

        - be detailed for negotiation (salary vs hourly) as uncomfortable as it may seem
        - know the scale of pay
        - what dimensions are negotiable
            - vacation, benefits, money, signing bonus, moving expenses, etc
        - who am i negotiating with
            - based on talk w/ negotiator, can tell what kind of negotiation you might end up in whether they're competitive, timid, etc
        - what are my alternatives
            - if internship offers to extend w/o pay, mention you have another offer but would've loved to stay at that internship company if they could pay
            - always have other job offers ready
            - try not to lie about it...
        - if there is a salary table, try to negotiate alternatives
            - ex may include govt, schools, companies with salary transparency, etc
        - don't be too scared to negotiate, companies will rarely rescind offer
        - why do we negotiate?
            - from employer side:
                - company will start with say let's offer 45-55k and start offer at 45k
                - if hire wants 50 or 55, company will say sure
                - if hire wants 60+, they'll discuss
                - basically, the difference is huge because it's also compounded over course of time at company
                - if you get salary emailed to you, doesn't mean you can't ask to call back to negotiate

    - SET A GOAL

        - accept the fact you don't have much developing background, be reasonable
        - figure out what the absolute minimum is
        - write down your goals
        - set opener smaller than your big dream on less important parts, closer to it on the more important parts
            - if you really value vacation, negotiate less on salary, more in increase in vacation days
            - if negotiating with someone competitive, bring more alternatives to what to negotiate to let them shut down alternatives and make them feel like they're 'winning' so you can still end up getting the things you want
        - what can we negotiate about?
            - salary
            - commute assistant (daily commute, work remote, etc)
                - remote work
                    - make sure you're getting you're work done
                    - make sure your coworkers know you're getting you're work done
                    - trial of short mid-week attempt at remote work
            - PTO
            - signing bonus
            - move assistance (tax deductable for them)
            - benefits plan?
                - can say don't need, but adjust salary for example
            - stock options/shadow stock/shadow options/profit sharing plan/direct stock
                - public company
                    - can sell stock whenever but may be limit x months after start
                - private company
                    - stock worth nothing, not sellable
                    - only value to it is if you die, direct inheritence could then sell it
                    - just a potential ticket to cash in in the future if they were to IPO like a lotto ticket
                - stock option
                    - gives right to buy stock at certain price in the future
                        - to get stock, must pay company to get the stock
                    - tricky, need to understand it
                    - watch out for ppl who try to convince you to work for stock options

    - OPENING

        - be bold and direct, but leave room for negotiation, OK to check w/ them to confirm they are ready
        - rob is almost always 1st to bring up number, helps both sides saves time
            - if they say yes, it may show they will be accommodating negotiator
        - start high with 'my expectation is $x / year'
        
    - FEARLESS DISCUSSION
    
        - remember goals and bottom line
            - if company offers way below your expectation like 45-55k could be good to say 'my goal is 90k/year, and i see we're far off, but could we start at 60k so we're closer, and should i expect that potential growth in the company in a couple years?'
        - make it feel like solving a problem together
        - try not to use VS language
            - don't use 'if you don't pay me i can't do this'
            - instead use '
        - active listening
            - good body language, repeat things back to confirm
        - honesty is easier to remember
        - don't say sorry unless you did something wrong, opens opportunity for others to push back at you
        - everyone gets a parting gift
            - think of what person did well, remember it

    - CLOSING

        - time for repair, fix up relationship if things got tense
        - remind them how excited you are
        - good to bring up things about themselves if they talked about it earlier
        - write down result on piece of paper, then send email confirming what was agreed upon

- first to get job, highest paid, is one that HUSTLES
    - What is hustle?
        - start job hunting NOW, not when internship starts
        - 1-2 meetups/week
        - 10-12 applications & followups / week
        - reach out to ppl/companies on linkedin
