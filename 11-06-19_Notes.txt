https://github.com/learn-academy-2019-echo/Syllabus/blob/master/PD-Week/Curriculum.md

Portfolio Feedback
- on large screens, try to make icons at bottom left and My Resume buttons larger
- make intro image longer so the white space at bottom doesn't seem like a mistake
- add either description to projects on portfolio or have a good description on github describing the project, what it solves, etc
- add list of skills
- under projects, can maybe include current portfolio template as one of my projects
- bryan - "skillsets don't necessarily have to be on resume since they're on resume, but good to mention in the project sections saying 'these are the technologies i built with'"
- mention location
- look into copyright at bottom...check the readme
- make clickable text links more noticeable
- remove prospective...we technically are web developers now



How to Ace the "user experience" or tech industry interviews

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BVYV42B-4tDQIgJMCbAsafQut91M-1e8/view
- focus on skill vs just education
- common questions to ask
    - who will i be meeting with?
    - is there anything i should bring to the interview?
    - are there any tests or evaluations that i'll be asked to perform?
    - where does this interview fit within my overall hiring process?
- research the organization
    - website, mission statement, values, overview, products, services, client-base, press releases
- get perspective
    - company's standing (note glassdoor typically is bad reviews, unless employees are incentivized to leave good reviews, take w/ grain of salt)
- develop question
    - prepare to ask organization or position based on research
    - be specific, don't ask 'dumb' questions
- compare skills & qualifications to job requirements
    - outline knowledge, skills, abilities required, and compare to self
    - if situation like job description taken off website months later when they respond, mention "send me most up-to-date job description"
- prepare responses
    - tell stories, don't get too caught up in the 'right' vs 'wrong' AKA the STAR method
        https://www.google.com/search?q=star+method&rlz=1C1AWUC_enUS740US784&oq=star+method&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.1097j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8
    - know what questions will be asked
    - STAR
        - 2 minutes in length, w/ energy & enthusiasm
        - resolving conflict, strengths/weaknesses, etc
        - Situation
            - new employee brainstorming meeting, manager cut in before idea was done
        - Task/Target
            - alleviate situation, allow everyone's voices to be heard since brainstorming is meant for ideas to be heard
        - Action
            - manager, new employee, i all met after the meeting, educate them on civil discourse, set guidelines for these staff meetings how it should be approached
        - Result
            - changed ways meetings were done, set aside brainstorming time for meetings for all
- practice tests/assessments (tech skills)
    - practice, practice, practice. do as much as possible
    - 2 possible types
        - one related to tech stack you'll be working on (simple like take array of #, return odd for example)
        - one more theoretical, algorithm based (one like fizzbuzz ones)
    - practice with codewars!
    - check out Pramp - pairs with real life person and white board together with someone at your level, appointment based
- what to wear
    - dress like the team, tech is more business casual, go one step up over how informal the company may be
    - look presentable, always have 2nd outfit ready to go
    - IRON CLOTHES
- bring
    - notebook
        - both take notes and notes for you to refer to during interview
    - hard copies of resume, cover letter, references, codebase, portfolio just in case
    - BRING LAPTOP, portfolio
    - OK to ask internship partners for references too even if you're applying to other places

------------------------------------------------------

Continued from previous slideshow
- pay attention to non-verbal communications
    - interview begins early before you even arrive, aka emails, etc are part of it
    - smile, firm handshake, body language, eye contact with everyone, do not unload/move in, try to reduce facial expressions of how you are feeling
- bring a list
    - prep list of questions to see if the organization is a good fit, be strategic, don't overask
    - cover info that hasn't been discussed or to clarify previous topic
    - if too many questions, be respectful and ask if it's alright to send them email of additional questions
    - if they bring up benefits package, see if they can redirect you to HR department so you can speak further in detail about
    - examples:
        - what do ppl love about working here?
        - what do you love about working with your dev team?
        - what do you consider the most important criteria for success in this job?
        - tell me about the organization's culture (slowly becoming more and more prevalent...instead maybe try something like:
            - how does your team approach problems?)
        - how has the position evolved, and how may it change moving forward?
        - ** what are the next steps in the hiring process?

    - email or handwritten note MUST
        - thanks, mention names, give tidbit why you enjoyed the visit

        - if morning interview, get follow-up out by end of the day
        - if afternoon interview, get follow-up out by the next morning
        - if they say contact hiring manager, include something along the lines of please forward to hiring committee
        - if you bombed tech interview, look up solution, send out how you would've finished question
